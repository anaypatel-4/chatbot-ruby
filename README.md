# chatbot-ruby
It is a simple website maade using Django, HTML and CSS. It is  a Chatbot for college admissions and answers FAQs related to the admission process. I have created and used my own dataset here named intents.json
If you want to use your custom dataset then make changes in intents.json file.
There are 3 separate files:
"intents.json" - Create your dataset.
"training.py" - To make changes in your model.
"chatbot.py" - main program
